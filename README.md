EpOraLibrary
=======================
#### Visual C++ Oracle OCI Wrapper Library ####


DESCRIPTION
-----------

As many people have experienced `Oracle OCCI Library`'s incompatibilities, and problems 
in many cases such as
- Unicode environment.
- Visual C++ Projects, that are linked with MFC Libraries.
- Visual C++ Projects linked with other multiple libraries.
- etc.

EpOraLibrary solves such issues, and makes it easier for Visual C++ developers 
to use Oracle Database Operation within their development projects. 
EpOraLibrary is a custom wrapper library of Oracle OCI Library under a [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
It supports Visual C++ 2005/2008/2010/2012.
Source can be downloaded at [EpOraLibrary](http://github.com/juhgiyo/eporalibrary)


FEATURES
--------

* Supports the most of operations that Oracle OCCI Library supports.
* No more linking problems, stated above.
* Supports full ASCII/Unicode development environment.
* Similar operation convention used as Oracle OCCI Library
  - People can be easily adapted to EpOralibrary.
* Easy installation 
  - No need to install any Oracle installation for the development.
  - See Installation Section below for the detail.


Installation
------------

* Link `EpOraLibrary.lib` and EpOraLibrary Header folders in your project.
* Add `oci.dll`, `orannzsbb10.dll`, `oraocci10.dll`, and `oraociei10.dll` to the same folder where your project executable exists.
* Done!

(** You may be required to install Oracle Client in case of using `TNS Name`, 
      or other advanced functionalities that this library does not support.)

Note
----

* `EpOraLibrary` is tested on `OracleDB 10g` (`Windows XP 32bit`, and `Windows7 32bit`) only.
* In order to use with other versions of OracleDB, you may need to get compatible version of `OracleDB Instant Client SDK` and re-compile the `EpOraLibrary` with new headers and libs in it. (EpOraLibrary may not be compiled.)
* The dlls, required, may vary among the versions of `OracleDB Instant Client SDK`.
